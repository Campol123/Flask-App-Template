# Flask App Template

Just a turn-key Flask app template that I created to reduce the amount of boilerplate code I end up writing. 

## Setup:

1. Make sure you have a valid Python interpreter installed
2. (Optional) Create a [virtual enviroment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)
3. run ```pip install Flask``` in your terminal
4. run wsgi.py to start the web server
5. go to ```127.0.0.1:5000``` to view the Hello World output
